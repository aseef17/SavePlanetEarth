        "description": "Through strategic partnerships, academic backing, and a strong budding crypto currency community, we have bundled ingredients to significantly change the earth’s landscape through carbon sequestration in coordination with international aid organizations and the public alike. Our overall goals include developing an enhanced green (tree cover) and better marine management, and lobbying for more meaningful legal controls and achieve commercial market maturity to wake up and face real costs of climate change.",

We do so by securing formidable ties with local administrators and action groups in a swift yet accountable manner. To do this an empowerment system would be made operative where we institute horizontal management systems in addition to established management structures and make them overall efficient by recourse to time study, and work measurement all part of work-study among our field practitioners."
